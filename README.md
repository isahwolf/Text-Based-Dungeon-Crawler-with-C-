* Removes current weapon if you pick up a new weapon
    * removes stats from removed weapon
    * adds stats from new weapon

* Displays message saying you picked up new weapon and dropped old weapon

* Still trying to figure equipment slots so can apply to all equipment types and give option to pick up new item or not.


* Added Level class and moved handleMovementActions() and printActions() to it
* Changed main.cpp to include the header files instead of the source files.
    * had to edit tasks.json and launch.json to make it work
